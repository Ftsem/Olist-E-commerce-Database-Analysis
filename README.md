# Olist-E-commerce

Olist is a Brazilian Startup with funding from multiple large banks and companies. It serves a similar niche as Amazon marketplace, connecting small and large sellers to customers on a single website, handling logistics of getting product to the customer from the seller. I have analysed the provided data from 2016 to 2018 to offer data-driven improvements to business operations and strategy.






# 1. Order Trends Over Time

As I investigated the Olist dataset, based on the available data, I decided to analyze the data with the goal of increasing the count of orders. One of the ways to improve it was through effective marketing campaigns and sales strategies, and one of the most important factors for a successful campaign or sale was timing.

To propose the optimal timing to the company, I focused on identifying trends in total order counts based on different days, times of day, and months.

#### 3. **Adjust Delivery and Order Timing:**

- Implement pre-holiday sales or target specific customer segments in **November** and **December** where orders dip.
- Investigate the causes of the dip during these months (e.g., external market factors or seasonality).
